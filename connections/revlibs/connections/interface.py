    Database connection parameters will be loaded from YAML/JSON config stored

    Opened connection should always be closed when it's not needed anymore,
    using connector `close()` method or from connection (`connection.close()`)

    Connector object will store established database connection inside, so on
    first call of method `get_connection()` it will open new connection and on
    next calls it will be returning already established connection unless
    connection will be closed using its internal method (`connection.close()`)
    or through connector object method `close()`.

    Example::
        connector = get_connector("exasol_db")
        connection = connector.get_connection()  # open new connection
        connection.execute("SELECT * FROM table1;")
